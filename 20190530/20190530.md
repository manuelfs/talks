# Introduction
## $B$ physics in this talk

In this talk, we focus on _possible_ lepton flavor universality
violation in semileptonic $B$ meson decays:

$$
B~\text{meson} \rightarrow D/D^\ast~\text{meson} + e/\mu/\tau + e/\mu/\tau~\text{neutrino}
$$

- $B$ mesons consist of a $b$ quark and another quark
- $D/D^\ast$ mesons have the same quark content, but different masses
- Leptons have 3 flavors: electron ($e$), muon ($\mu$), tauon ($\tau$)

## What is $R(D^{(\ast)})$?
$R(D^{(\ast)})$ is a shortcut to denote 2 double ratios: $R(D), R(D^\ast)$.
They are defined as:

$$
R(D^{(\ast)}) \equiv
\frac{\text{number of events}~B \rightarrow D^{(\ast)} + \tau + \tau~\text{neutrino}}
{\text{number of events}~B \rightarrow D^{(\ast)} + \mu + \mu~\text{neutrino}}
$$

## Side: Mass of quarks and leptons

## Side: Mass of selected mesons

## Why do we need $B$ meson?

## What is lepton flavor universality violation?

Standard model (SM) predicts that aside from their masses, $e, \mu, \tau$
participate in all SM processes in exactly the same way (lepton flavor
universality).

In other words, lepton flavor should not matter, as far as SM is concerned.

# Analysis techniques
## How an analysis is done

After collecting data with the detector, we need to:

- Study the Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation to predict expected behaviors of data,
  and to better understand how a particular detector would affect our
  measurements
- Use the knowledge gained in MC and other means to make necessary corrections
  (e.g. rescale the momentum)
- Apply selections to data so that we can classify them as signal/background,
  etc.
- Fit data with some type of model
