# Introduction
## Why LHCb?
It seems not so easy to discover new physics _directly_ these days: Produce new
elementry particles and observed them directly.

- CMS and ATLAS's hallmark discovery is still the Higgs boson in 2012, which is
  part of the standard model (SM) prediction
- LHCb can probe physics beyond SM _indirectly_: By measuring some processes
  very precisely, we can tell if the measurements agree with SM prediction. If
  not, we know there must be new physics beyond SM

## What is lepton flavor universality?
SM predicts that aside from their masses, $e, \mu, \tau$ participate in all SM
processes in exactly the same way (lepton flavor universality).

\begin{exampleblock}{Note}
In other words, we can treat all 3 flavors of leptons as the same, except for
their masses, as far as SM is concerned.
\end{exampleblock}
```

## Test Lepton flavor universality in semileptonic $B$ decays
In this talk, we focus on test of lepton flavor universality in semileptonic
$B$ meson decays:

$$
B~\text{meson} \rightarrow
\underbrace{D/D^\ast~\text{meson}}_{\text{\text{hadronic}}} +
\underbrace{e/\mu/\tau + e/\mu/\tau~\text{neutrino}}_{\text{leptonic}}
$$

- $B$ mesons consist of a $b$ quark and another quark
- $D/D^\ast$ mesons have the same quark content, but different masses
- Leptons have 3 flavors: electron ($e$), muon ($\mu$), tauon ($\tau$)

## Side: Mass of quarks and leptons

## Side: Mass of selected mesons

## What is $R(D^{(\ast)})$?
$R(D^{(\ast)})$ is a shortcut to denote 2 double ratios: $R(D), R(D^\ast)$.
They are defined as:

$$
R(D^{(\ast)}) \equiv
\frac{\text{number of events}~B \rightarrow D^{(\ast)} + \tau + \tau~\text{neutrino}}
{\text{number of events}~B \rightarrow D^{(\ast)} + \mu + \mu~\text{neutrino}}
$$

```{=latex}
\begin{exampleblock}{Note}
SM predicts $R(D) = 0.299 \pm 0.011$, and $R(D^\ast) = 0.300 \pm 0.008$,
because $\mu, \tau$ have different masses.
\end{exampleblock}
```

## Recent measurements of $R(D^{(\ast)})$

- In 2012, BaBar measured both $R(D), R(D^\ast)$, with

        a -- [photon, edge label=\(\gamma\), momentum'=\(k\)] b,
        f1 [particle=\(\mu^{+}\)] -- [fermion] b -- [fermion] f2 [particle=\(\mu^{-}\)],
    };

## How an analysis is done
After collecting data with detectors, we need to:

- Study the Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation to predict expected behaviors of data,
  and to better understand how a particular detector would affect our
  measurements
- Use the knowledge gained in MC and other means to make necessary corrections
  (e.g. rescale the momentum)
- Apply selections to data so that we can classify them as signal/background,
  etc.
- Fit data with some type of model

## On the shape of the momentum transfer $q^2$
