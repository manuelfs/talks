# Introduction
## Why LHCb?
It seems not so easy to discover new physics _directly_ these days: Produce new
elementry particles and observed them directly.

- CMS and ATLAS's hallmark discovery is still the Higgs boson in 2012, which is
  part of the standard model (SM) prediction
- LHCb can probe physics beyond SM _indirectly_: By measuring some processes
  very precisely, we can tell if the measurements agree with SM prediction. If
  not, we know there must be new physics beyond SM

## What is lepton flavor universality?
SM predicts that aside from their masses, $e, \mu, \tau$ participate in all SM
processes in exactly the same way (lepton flavor universality).

### Note
In other words, we can treat all 3 flavors of leptons as the same, except for
their masses, as far as SM is concerned.

## Test Lepton flavor universality in semileptonic $B$ decays
In this talk, we focus on test of lepton flavor universality in semileptonic
$B$ meson decays:

$$
B~\text{meson} \rightarrow
\underbrace{D/D^\ast~\text{meson}}_{\text{\text{hadronic}}} +
\underbrace{e/\mu/\tau + e/\mu/\tau~\text{neutrino}}_{\text{leptonic}}
$$

- $B$ mesons consist of a $b$ quark and another quark
- $D/D^\ast$ mesons have the same quark content, but different masses
- Leptons have 3 flavors: electron ($e$), muon ($\mu$), tauon ($\tau$)

## Side: Mass of quarks and leptons
### Quarks
----------------------------  ----------------------------------  -------------------------------
$u$: $2.2 +\!0.5 -\!0.4$ MeV  $c$: $1.275 +\!0.025 -\!0.035$ GeV  $t$: $173.0 \pm 0.4$ GeV
$d$: $4.7 +\!0.5 -\!0.3$ MeV  $s$: $95 +\!9 -\!3$ MeV             $b$: $4.18 +\!0.04 -\!0.03$ GeV
----------------------------  ----------------------------------  -------------------------------

### Leptons
- $e$: $0.5109989461 \pm 0.0000000031$ MeV
- $\mu$: $105.6583745 \pm 0.0000024$ MeV
- $\tau$: $1776.86 \pm 0.12$ MeV
- neutrinos ($\nu_e, \nu_\mu, \nu_\tau$): they have different masses, but very
  small. In momentum conservation calculation, we typically treat them as
  _massless_

$\pi^+$      $u\bar{d}$                           $139.57018 \pm 0.00035$ MeV

$B^0$        $d\bar{b}$                           $5279.62 \pm 0.15$ MeV
$B^+$        $u\bar{b}$                           $5279.31 \pm 0.15$ MeV

## What is $R(D^{(\ast)})$?
$R(D^{(\ast)})$ is a shortcut to denote 2 double ratios: $R(D), R(D^\ast)$.
They are defined as:

$$
R(D^{(\ast)}) \equiv
\frac{\text{number of events}~B \rightarrow D^{(\ast)} + \tau + \tau~\text{neutrino}}
{\text{number of events}~B \rightarrow D^{(\ast)} + \mu + \mu~\text{neutrino}}
$$

### Note
SM predicts $R(D) = 0.299 \pm 0.011$, and $R(D^\ast) = 0.300 \pm 0.008$, _not_ 1.
Because $e, \mu, \tau$ have different masses, and the heavier ones are harder
to produce.

## Recent measurements of $R(D^{(\ast)})$

- In 2012, BaBar measured
  $R(D) = 0.440 \pm 0.058 \pm 0.042$, and
  $R(D^\ast) = 0.332 \pm 0.024 \pm 0.018$,
  with $2.0 \sigma$ and $2.7 \sigma$ discrepancies from the SM predictions
- There are at least 5 subsequent measurements on $R(D)$, $R(D^\ast)$, or both
  by BELLE and LHCb
- Current world average of $R(D), R(D^\ast)$ with correlation taken into
  account has a $3.08 \sigma$ deviation from current SM predictions

## Side: 4-momentum definitions
- $p^\mu = \left(E, p_x, p_y, p_z\right)$. Note that we set $c = 1$
- $\eta_{\mu\nu} =
  \begin{pmatrix}
      1 &  0 &  0 &  0 \\
      0 & -1 &  0 &  0 \\
      0 &  0 & -1 &  0 \\
      0 &  0 &  0 & -1
  \end{pmatrix}$
- $p_\mu = p^\nu \eta_{\mu\nu}$. Note that here $\nu$ is a dummy index, and
  will be summed over
- Inner product/Dot product: $p^\mu p_\mu$. Again, $\mu$ is dummy

## Side: 4-momentum conservation
- In our context, We always assume that the total 4-momentum of the system is
  conserved. That is:
  $$
  \sum p^\mu_i = \sum p^\mu_j
  $$
- Also, the invariant mass is conserved:
  $$
  \left(\sum p^\mu_i\right) \left(\sum p_{\mu,i}\right) =
  \left(\sum p^\mu_j\right) \left(\sum p_{\mu,j}\right)
  $$

## Exercise: Will the following processes happen?
### Single $\gamma$ decays into $e^-e^+$?

### $e^-e^+$ pair production?

## Why do we use $B$ meson to test lepton flavor universality?

Starting from $D$ mesons, it is kinematically possible to produce $\tau$.
But we are still using $B$ mesons, mainly for the following reasons:

- B factores (such as BaBar and BELLE) were initially designed to study CP
  violation, which is more significant in B mesons. The 2012 BaBar paper
  elicited the interest in the lepton flavor universality violation business
- B mesons, being significantly heavier than D mesons, should have stronger
  coupling to beyond SM particles. One possible explanation to the anormalie is
  the charged Higgs model, which does have a stronger coupling to $B$.


# Comparison between $e^{-}e^{+}$ and $p\bar{p}$ colliders
## How do we produce B mesons in colliders?
### $e^{-}e^{+}$ colliders
Tune the invariant mass of $e^-e^+$ so that it is right at the mass of $B$ meson.
Note that $e$ is an elementary particle, and it can use all of its avaliable
energy.

### $p\bar{p}$ colliders
Collide $p\bar{p}$ at a much higher energy, and let the quarks inside protons
produce B randomly. Note that $p$ is a composite particle, thus cannot fully
utilize its energy.

```

## Comparison of BaBar and LHCb performance
### BaBar

- Cleaner background, since we are at $B$ mass resonance
- Know the $B$ rest frame energy
- Better precision on the missing mass due to tagging
- Fewer events generated
- Better calorimeter (due to the design of the BaBar)

### LHCb

- Very messy background, since $p\bar{p}$ can generate any particle with mass
  below the rest frame energy
- Doesn't know the $B$ rest frame energy, so we have to approximate it
- Worse precision on the missing mass
- Much more events, so better statistical uncertainty
- Better tracking


# Analysis techniques
## How an analysis is done

- Model the detector, and generate Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation
- Study the MC to predict expected behaviors of data, and to better understand
  how a particular detector would affect our measurements
- Use the knowledge gained in MC and other means to make necessary corrections
  (e.g. rescale the momentum)
- Apply selections to data so that we can classify them as signal/background,
  etc.
- Fit data with some type of model

## $B$ tagging in BaBar
### Semileptonic tagging
$$
e^-e^+ \rightarrow (B_{sig} \rightarrow \text{semileptonic decay}) (B_{tag} \rightarrow \text{semileptonic decay})
$$

- Total number of $B_{tag}$ is larger
- The $B_{sig} B_{tag}$ system always has more than 1 neutrino, making the
  estimation of 4-momentum, and missing mass less precise

### Hadronic tagging
$$
e^-e^+ \rightarrow (B_{sig} \rightarrow \text{semileptonic decay}) (B_{tag} \rightarrow \text{hadronic decay})
$$

- Fewer tagged $B$
- For semileptonic decay to $\mu$, only 1 missing neutrino, more precise estimation

![
As we can see, the signal region has non-0 missing mass. The background region is mostly a Gaussian, this is due to uncertainties in measurement.
