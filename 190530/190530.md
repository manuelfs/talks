# Introduction
## Why LHCb?
It seems not so easy to discover new physics _directly_ these days: Produce new
elementry particles and observed them directly.

- CMS and ATLAS's hallmark discovery is still the Higgs boson in 2012, which is
  part of the standard model (SM) prediction
- LHCb can probe physics beyond SM _indirectly_: By measuring some processes
  very precisely, we can tell if the measurements agree with SM prediction. If
  not, we know there must be new physics beyond SM

## What is lepton flavor universality?
SM predicts that aside from their masses, $e, \mu, \tau$ participate in all SM
processes in exactly the same way (lepton flavor universality).

### Note
In other words, we can treat all 3 flavors of leptons as the same, except for
their masses, as far as SM is concerned.

## Test Lepton flavor universality in semileptonic $B$ decays
In this talk, we focus on test of lepton flavor universality in semileptonic
$B$ meson decays:

$$
B~\text{meson} \rightarrow
\underbrace{D/D^\ast~\text{meson}}_{\text{\text{hadronic}}} +
\underbrace{e/\mu/\tau + e/\mu/\tau~\text{neutrino}}_{\text{leptonic}}
$$

- $B$ mesons consist of a $b$ quark and another quark
- $D/D^\ast$ mesons have the same quark content, but different masses
- Leptons have 3 flavors: electron ($e$), muon ($\mu$), tauon ($\tau$)

## Side: Mass of quarks and leptons
### Quarks
----------------------------  ----------------------------------  -------------------------------
$u$: $2.2 +\!0.5 -\!0.4$ MeV  $c$: $1.275 +\!0.025 -\!0.035$ GeV  $t$: $173.0 \pm 0.4$ GeV
$d$: $4.7 +\!0.5 -\!0.3$ MeV  $s$: $95 +\!9 -\!3$ MeV             $b$: $4.18 +\!0.04 -\!0.03$ GeV
----------------------------  ----------------------------------  -------------------------------

### Leptons

## Side: Mass of selected mesons

## What is $R(D^{(\ast)})$?
$R(D^{(\ast)})$ is a shortcut to denote 2 double ratios: $R(D), R(D^\ast)$.
They are defined as:

$$
R(D^{(\ast)}) \equiv
\frac{\text{number of events}~B \rightarrow D^{(\ast)} + \tau + \tau~\text{neutrino}}
{\text{number of events}~B \rightarrow D^{(\ast)} + \mu + \mu~\text{neutrino}}
$$

### Note
SM predicts $R(D) = 0.299 \pm 0.011$, and $R(D^\ast) = 0.300 \pm 0.008$, _not_ 1.
Because $e, \mu, \tau$ have different masses, and the heavier ones are harder
to produce.

## Recent measurements of $R(D^{(\ast)})$

- In 2012, BaBar measured
  $R(D) = 0.440 \pm 0.058 \pm 0.042$, and
  $R(D^\ast) = 0.332 \pm 0.024 \pm 0.018$,
  with $2.0 \sigma$ and $2.7 \sigma$ discrepancies from the SM predictions
- There are at least 5 subsequent measurements on $R(D)$, $R(D^\ast)$, or both by BELLE and LHCb
- Current world average of $R(D), R(D^\ast)$ with correlation taken into
  account has a $3.08 \sigma$ deviation from current SM predictions

## Side: 4-momentum

# Analysis techniques
## How an analysis is done
After collecting data with detectors, we need to:

- Study the Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation to predict expected behaviors of data,
  and to better understand how a particular detector would affect our
  measurements
- Use the knowledge gained in MC and other means to make necessary corrections
  (e.g. rescale the momentum)
- Apply selections to data so that we can classify them as signal/background,
  etc.
- Fit data with some type of model

## On the shape of the momentum transfer $q^2$

## On the relation between the shape of $m_{miss}$ and $q^2$
