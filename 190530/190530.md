# Introduction
## $B$ physics in this talk

- In this talk, we focus on _possible_ lepton flavor universality
  violation in semileptonic $B$ meson decays:
  $$
  B~\text{meson} \rightarrow D/D^\ast~\text{meson} + e/\mu/\tau + \text{neutrino}
  $$
- $B$ mesons consist of a $b$ quark and another quark
- $D/D^\ast$ mesons have the same quark content, but different masses
- Leptons refer to electron ($e$), muon ($\mu$), tauon ($\tau$)

## What is $R(D^{(\ast)})$?

## What is lepton flavor universality violation?

- Standard model (SM) predicts that aside from their masses, $e, \mu, \tau$
  participate in all SM processes in exactly the same way

### Question
How do we produce B mesons in colliders?

# Comparison between $e^{-}e^{+}$ and $p\bar{p}$ colliders
## $e^{-}e^{+}$ colliders

## $p\bar{p}$ colliders

## Single event comparison between BaBar and LHCb

## Side: 4-momentum

## Semileptonic $B$ tagging in BaBar


# Analysis techniques
## How an analysis is done

After collecting data with the detector, we need to:

- Study the Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation to better understand how a particular
  detector would affect our measurements
- Use the knowledge gained in MC and other means to make necessary corrections
  (e.g. rescale the momentum)
- Apply selections to data so that we can classify them as signal/background,
  etc.
- Fit data with some type of model

## Fit, in layman's term
